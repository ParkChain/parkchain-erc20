# ERC20

ERC-20 is a technical standard for creating and implementing tokens on the blockchain. 

ERC-20 defines a set of rules and functions that a token contract must follow to be compatible with the Parkchain ecosystem.

Some of the functions defined in the ERC-20 standard include transferring tokens between addresses, checking the token balance of an address, approving addresses to spend a certain amount of tokens on behalf of the owner, and getting the total supply of tokens. 
    
These functions allow for the basic functionalities of sending, receiving, and managing tokens within the Parkchain ecosystem.

ERC-20 has become the most widely adopted token standard on the ParkChain blockchain, and many of the tokens in circulation today, such as Parkchain itself (KPK), are ERC-20 compliant. The standard has played a significant role in the development of the initial coin offering (ICO) boom and the subsequent growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.
